# Phase 1 BLAZE Configuration
# High-performance local Bloch problems using the blaze2d eigensolver
#
# This replaces the MPB-based Phase 1 with a ~100-250x faster implementation
# using the BLAZE (Band-structure LOBPCG Accelerated Zone Eigensolver) package.

# ===== Candidate Selection =====
K_candidates: 1  # Process top 1 candidates from Phase 0

# ===== Moiré Spatial Grid =====
# High resolution for accurate EA operator
phase1_Nx: 64  # 64x64 = 4096 grid points
phase1_Ny: 64
effective_moire_scale: 12.0

# ===== Twist Geometry =====
tau: [0.0, 0.0]  # Stacking gauge vector
eta: auto  # Use a/L_moire for physical η
default_theta_deg: 1.1  # Default twist angle

# ===== BLAZE Computation Settings =====
# Resolution for the FDFD grid
blaze_resolution: 48  # Higher resolution for accuracy (32 is minimum)

# Finite difference settings for Hessian computation
blaze_dk: 0.005  # Fine k-space step for accurate derivatives
blaze_fd_order: 4  # 4th order FD for Hessian (requires 5x5 stencil)

# Polarization (TM for air holes in dielectric, TE for dielectric rods in air)
blaze_polarization: "TE"

# Threading: 0 = auto, -1 = adaptive, >0 = fixed count
blaze_threads: 16

# Registry sampling: sample NxN points in [0,1) × [0,1) and interpolate
blaze_registry_samples: 64  # 64x64 = 4096 registry samples

# Direct sampling mode: when true, samples at exactly Nx×Ny grid points
# This disables interpolation and provides exact per-point band values
# Use for comparison with MPB (slower but eliminates interpolation smoothing)
blaze_direct_sampling: false  # Set to true for MPB-like per-point sampling

# ===== Reference Frequency =====
ref_frequency_mode: 'mean'  # Use mean frequency as reference

# ===== Output Settings =====
output_dir: "runs"
save_reference_band: false

# ===== Registry Mapping =====
# How to compute δ(R) registry map
# Use 1.0 (legacy) for correct registry normalization - gives |δ| < 1 at moiré cell edge
# Using 'physical' η scales up by L_moiré/a which is incorrect
phase1_registry_eta: 1.0

# ===== Variation Tolerance =====
phase1_variation_tol: 1e-5  # Warn if omega0 has less variation than this
