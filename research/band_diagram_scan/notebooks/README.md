# Notebooks

Placeholder for exploratory notebooks that inspect the generated HDF5 band library.

Suggested starters:

- `explore_band_library.ipynb`: plot band diagrams for selected parameter tuples.
- `sanity_checks.ipynb`: verify convergence vs. MPB resolution or r/a sampling.

> Notebooks are intentionally omitted until the simulation data pipeline is validated.
