# Phase 0 Score Weighting Playground

import Phase0ScoringExplorer from '../../src/components/Phase0ScoringExplorer';

Phase 0 relies on five partial scores—curvature, spectral isolation, parabolic extent, group velocity suppression, and dielectric contrast—to rank monolayer candidates. The explorer below mirrors the exact normalization and defaults from `common/scoring.py`, so any weights you dial in here can be dropped directly into your YAML configs.

## 1. Extremum intuition

Use the curvature and slope sliders to see how a quadratic band responds. The dashed lines sketch an artificial spectral gap; the cards below the plot report the resulting `S_flat`, `S_gap`, `S_parab`, and `S_vg` values so you can reason about how far a candidate is from the target envelopes.

## 2. Weight selection & gallery

The second block is a matrix of synthetic candidates spanning high-gap / low-gap, flat / steep, and low / high contrast regimes. Each tile shows a stacked bar whose colors match the scoring terms, letting you spot which regimes dominate the total score for the current weight set. When you are satisfied, hit “Copy weights” to grab a snippet that can be pasted inside `configs/phase0_real_run.yaml` (or any other Phase 0 config).
